# The WarShip Game

## A front-end web application that game players interact with, and a back-end game server to manage the games, scoring, and player profiles. 

The core arquitecture was made :
- A small Java back-end server to store Salvo game data, and send that data to client apps via a RESTful API.
- A front-end browser-based game interface that graphically shows players the state of the game, including ships they've placed, damage sustained, and scores.

## Use Javascipt, Jquery, Vue.Js to 
- Send and and retrieve data from a web service using AJAX 
- Construct HTML displays using templates

## Use Java and the Spring Boot suite of tools to
- Implement a RESTful API to both the database and application services
- Apply modern-day Java programming concepts, such as lambdas, streams, and dependency injection

## Use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structures to
- Communicate between your application's JavaScript front-end and Java back-end
- Implement the "model" in a model-view-controller
